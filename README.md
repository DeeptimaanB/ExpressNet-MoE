## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

**ExpressNet-MoE** combines the power of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with deep neural architectures to enhance the performance of emotion recognition systems. This hybrid approach aims to improve model generalization and adaptability across diverse datasets and emotional contexts.

Key highlights include:
- **Modular architecture** using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
- **Optimized for emotion recognition** across multiple datasets
- **Extensive experimentation** and model comparisons
- **Reproducible development** using Python and Jupyter Notebooks
